# Movie-Recommendation

This project is created in IDLE - Pythonâ€™s Integrated Development and Learning Environment.

I have used data from grouplens.org to check the recommender system in this project. 

Movie_data.py is the file that I have used to create all the dictionaries from the data downloaded from the grouplens.org. 

All the dictionaries are stored in a pickle file movie_model.p, so that can be used further in recommendation function. 

Content-based recommendation system functions are written in movie_recommend.py. 

Collaborative filtering base recommendation system functions are written in recommend.py
